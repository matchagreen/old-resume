              I had the opportunity to obtain an internship at Qualtrics,
              where I worked as a Software Development Engineer Intern on an internal Flask REST API that will help
              save around 100 days of engineering time per quarter. I made
              a lot of friends and memories during those four months in Seattle.
              One of the best experiences in my life!

              During this time I worked as an Instructional Assistant
              for a Computer Architecture class of 50 students. I
              helped them with questions regarding architecture concepts,
              as well as with coding related questions. For this classed,
              we used C as the primary language for the assignments, and
              RISCV as the architecture for explaining concepts.

              For my first internship, I worked as a Web Developer Tester. My
              job was mostly related to testing web applications using tools
              such as NVDA for accessibility and Fiddler for testing
              security against injection attacks (HTML and SQL).

              I was born in El Paso, Texas. However, most of my life,
              I have lived in La Paz, Baja California Sur. This is a small
              city in Mexico, a place for tourists to enjoy el malecon,
              seafood, and the view.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I attended a high school named CBTIS 230, where I was
              introduced to circuits, boolean algebra, physics, and other
              engineering and scientific topics. Although I was sure I
              wanted to do something related to the STEM field, I hadn't
              figured out what field I would pursue. During that time,
              I was in the Electronics workshop from my institution.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              After graduating from high school, I returned to El Paso and
              attended classes at EPCC as a Physics major. At some point, I
              had the chance to enroll in a Computer Science class at my
              college. Ultimately, this class brought me a lot of fun and
              a lot of challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Outside of school and work, I enjoy playing guitar,
              videogames, doing crochet, walking, and learning new things,
              specially if they bring me happiness.
